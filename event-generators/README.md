# Event Generators

Generate realistic device and pricing events, modeled on real-world events.

## Running

Show the help
```
 java -jar target/event-generators-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
 java -jar target/event-generators-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --help
```

Run the device event generator

```
 java -jar target/event-generators-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    events --target http://host:1234/my/path
````

Run the pricing generator

```
 java -jar target/event-generators-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
    pricing --target http://host:1234/my/path
````

Event generators can also be run with an optional `--seed` flag, that takes a long, to set the 
random seed used for generating events, enabling a reproducable stream of events.

See `--help` for more information.

## Event Information

### Device Events

Device events have a number of fields
 * deviceDAO: how many watts the device has charged since the last event
 * regionId: UUID of the geographic region for the device
 * deviceId: UUID of the device
 
The timestamp of the event is considered to be the time of event's arrival.

## Building the generators

```
 mvn clean package
```

Creates a `-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in the `target/` directory, which can then be run.
